# Landing-Page

In this project I am trying to recreate a website. Using my resources and own knowledge, I should be able to recreate it using flex, styling methods, and properly setting up both the html and css files. Also I should be able to make this project available on GitHub and be able to push. 

## Desired Outcome

The outcome does not have to be pixel perfect. As long as it ressembles the desired outcome, then the project should be fine. No cheating and good luck to myself!
